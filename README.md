<h1>The Bedrock Of DBMS</h1>
<h3>An article explaining the building blocks of database management system</h3>


<p>
The primary objective of this article is to define and explain what database managemeent system are and what they do.
The article also shows that there are different kinds of DBMS for different types of technology project and it
also explores the type of dbms and their respective models.
</p>


<h3>INTRODUCTION </h3>


<p>
Before the creation of databases, Data which is a set of dinstinct information had to be stored or recorded on pieces of paper
In that process thousands of journals , ledgers and countless archives were created which contained billions 
records ... well thats alot of papers.
    When it was time to fecth the records it turned to be a very strenous task. They were often problems that arised  from misplaced 
records to emergence of environmental hazards like fire, DBMS and database were created to try  and solve this problems.
In the modern world data seem to be a thing that is constantly evolving every second, it has created a facet of growth and 
challenges for many institutions, Enterprises and Companies in that process.

<h3>WHAT IS A DBMS</h3>
<p>
A database management system is a system  that facilitates the definitions and management
of data in databases.
 They establishes a systematic way of create,updating, retreiving and managing data which makes
it possible for progarmmers to  perfrom crud operations " CREATE READ  UPDATE DELETE"  on data in a database.
Database management systems have been playing crucial part in the creation and modifaction of data,
They are so needed for their efficieny in running and managing data, And They also important to businesses and 
organizations because they provide an highly efficient method for handling multiple types of data.
</p>



<h4>TYPES OF DBMS</h4>
<p> Although there are more than 4 types of DBMS, In this article i would speaking about the most widely used system.</p>


<h3> Relational Database Managment System "RDBMS"  </h3>

<p>which is one of the most populary type of dbms is based on a relational model. A relational model is an approach or method of managing or structuring data into relations. A relation is a table consist of a tuple and a column.

In this model, data is stored in predefined structures and they are usually manipulated through the use of SQL or Structured 
Query Language. One of the main advantage of the relational databases is that it provides consistency in data.

Project managers and analyst hava to do a strict and thorough analysis before a database of this model can be popualted and used, This in turns ensures the availability of the systems and wont cause errors at any point in time. </p>

<p> Examples of RDBMS are</p>

<ul>
<li>MySQL</li>
<li>PostgreSQL</li>
<li>MariaDB</li>
<li>SQLite</li>
</ul>

<strong> NOTE: All RDBMS databses share commom functionalities, tools and 
also a method of structing data using relations.</strong>



<h3> OBJECT ORIENTED DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  "OODBMS"  </h3>


<p>This type of system is categorised under the NOSQL. NOSQl "NON  SQL" refers to system that uses others query laguage to store and manipulate asides SQl .
Data in this system is represented in form of objects as used in obejct oriented progamming.

object oriented database management system is system that combines the capabilties of a database with the principles
of OOP " Object Oriented Programming" . The power of the object-oriented databases comes from the cyclical treatment of both consistent data, 
as found in databases, and transient data, as found in executing programs.

Because this system can integrate with any programming language that is based on OOP, it makes it easier for 
programmers to maintain consistency due to thier knowledge in oop
OODBMS implemenents the use of OBJECT QUERY LANGUAGE "OQL" which is a query language standard  for OODBMS modeled after SQL But
no one has tried to fully implement OQl because of its overall complexity...   </p>


<p> Some examples databases that are based on the OODBMS model are </p>

<ul>  
<li>InterSystems Cach√© </li>
<li>ConceptBase</li>
<li>WakandaDB</li>
<li>ObjectDatabase++</li>
<li>Realm</li>
</ul>





<h3>GRAPH DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</h3>

<p> This system implements the use of graph structures for sematic queries, 
Data are stored in form of Nodes, edges and properties.
In this systems nodes represents an entity such as an employee, a person or an object. 
Graph databases are also categorized under NoSQL databases which were
created to address the limitations of the existing relational databases. 

While the graph model explicitly lays out the dependencies between nodes of data, 
the relational model and some other NoSQL database models link data by implicit connections.
Graph databases, by design, allow simple and fast retrieval.

 As of 2017, no single graph query language has been universally adopted in the
same way as SQL was for relational databases, and there is a wide variety of systems, most often tightly 
tied to one product. Some standardization efforts have occurred, leading to multi-vendor query languages like
Gremlin, SPARQL, and Cypher. In addition to having query language interfaces, 
some graph databases are accessed through application programming interfaces "API". </p>



<p>Examples of this systems are</p>

<ul>
<li>Neo4j</li>
<li>AllegroGraph</li>
<li>InfinitGraph</li>
<li>FlockDB</oli>
</ul>



<h3>DOCUMENT DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</h3>

<p>  Document orientated DBMS are systems designed for storing, modfying and managing semi-structured data such as
document.this particular type of systems is a crucial member of the NOSQL family.
Databases using the the document oriented model are very easy for developers or engineers to use because data are
stored in either JSON or XML.
This  system uses internal structure of the document for identification and storage.the system also saves all
information for a given item in a single instance of a database rather spread out over tables as with relational system </p>



<p>Examples of this systems are</p>

<ul>
<li>MongoDB</li>
<li>CouchDB</li>
<li>DocumentDB</li>
<li>OrientDB</li>
</ul>


<h3> THE TAKEAWAY  </h3>

<p> 

Most databases that fall under the non-relational umbrella " NOSQL" share common goals of speed and scalability. 
By breaking away from the relational storage model and leaving schemas behind, 
these databases are free of the limitations put upon them by a tightly bound schema


Databases have also come along way since thier creation in the 1960s, Initially they were a solution to the problem
of storing and protecting information we wrote down and making it more accessible at a faster rate. But over 
time they have become an integral part of our society and we solely rely on them for banking, security, policing and
provision of services for our digital lives. Big data is now helping find new insights from data we may have generated
in the past and it would be a very vital instrument in undertanding the society of the future.
Thank you..
