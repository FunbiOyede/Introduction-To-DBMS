<h1>DBMS IN THE ULTRA-MODERN WORLD</h1>
<h3>An article explaining the building blocks of database management system</h3>


<p>
The primary objective of this article is to define and explain what database managemeent system are and what they do.
The article also shows that there are different kinds of DBMS for different types of technology project and it
also explores the type of dbms and their respective models.
</p>


<h3>INTRODUCTION </h3>

<p>
 In this digital age, data is king. Businesses that can succesfully store and manage thier data have a compettive advantage over those that are overhelmed by the flow of information.With some many businesses sittingon more data than before, the demand softwares to handle this task is at an all-time high.
 
 By collecting minute and updated data, companies are using the said information to achieve their goals in a systematic way on one hand and empower their business in a strategic manner on the other hand. 
<p>



<h3>WHAT ARE DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS</h3>
<p>
Database management systems, also known as DBMS are sfotware programs that acts as a connecting point or a bridge bewteen databases and various end users and appilcation that needs access to them. The purpose of a DBMS is to provide businesses with an access point to  facilitates the definition and management of data in databases.
 
Though the terms have become somewhat synonymous over time, a database and a DBMS are not the same thing. A database is simply a collection of related data. A DBMS, on the other hand, is a tool to manage and organize multiple databases. In other words, the database stores the data, while the DBMS accesses and manipulates it.

<h4>TYPES OF DBMS</h4>
<p>This article focuses on the  four most widely used Database management system </p>


<h3> Relational Database Managment System "RDBMS"  </h3>

<p>which is one of the most populary type of dbms is based on a relational model. A relational model is an approach or method of managing or structuring data into relations. A relation is a table consist of a tuple and a column.

In this model, data is stored in predefined structures and they are usually manipulated through the use of SQL or Structured 
Query Language. One of the main advantage of the relational databases is that it provides consistency in data.

Project managers and analyst hava to do a strict and thorough analysis before a database of this model can be popualted and used, This in turns ensures the availability of the systems and wont cause errors at any point in time. </p>

<p> Examples of databases based on this system

<ul>
<li>MySQL</li>
<li>PostgreSQL</li>
<li>MariaDB</li>
<li>SQLite</li>
</ul>

<strong>All RDBMS databases share common functionalities, tools and 
also a method of structuring data using relations.</strong>



<h3> OBJECT ORIENTED DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM  "OODBMS"  </h3>


<p>This type of system is categorised under the NOSQL. NOSQl "NON  SQL" refers to system that uses others query laguage to store and manipulate asides SQl .
Data in this system is represented in form of objects as used in obejct oriented progamming.

Data in this system is represented in form of objects as used in object oriented programming. Object oriented database management system is system that combines the capabilities of a database with the principles of OOP " Object Oriented Programming" . The power of the object-oriented databases comes from the cyclical treatment of both consistent data as found in databases, and transient data, as found in executing programs.
Because this system can integrate with any programming language that is based on OOP, it makes it easier for programmers to maintain consistency due to thier knowledge in oop OODBMS implements the use of OBJECT QUERY LANGUAGE "OQL" which is a query language standard for OODBMS modeled after SQL,  but no one has tried to fully implement OQl because of its overall complexity…  </p>


<p> Examples of databases based on this system </p>

<ul>  
<li>InterSystems Caché </li>
<li>ConceptBase</li>
<li>WakandaDB</li>++
<li>ObjectDatabase++</li>
<li>Realm</li>
</ul>





<h3>GRAPH DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</h3>

<p> This system implements the use of graph structures for semantic queries, 
Data are stored in form of Nodes, edges and properties.
In this systems nodes represents an entity such as an employee, a person or an object. Graph databases are also categorized under NOSQL databases which were created to address the limitations of the existing relational databases.
While the graph model explicitly lays out the dependencies between nodes of data, the relational model and some other NOSQL database models link data by implicit connections. Graph databases, by design, allow simple and fast retrieval.
As of 2017, no single graph query language has been universally adopted in the same way as SQL was for relational databases, and there is a wide variety of systems, most often tightly tied to one product. Some standardization efforts have occurred, leading to multi-vendor query languages like
Gremlin, SPARQL, and Cypher. In addition to having query language interfaces, some graph databases are accessed through the use of application programming interfaces "API". </p>



<p>Examples of databases based on this system</p>

<ul>
<li>Neo4j</li>
<li>AllegroGraph</li>
<li>InfinitGraph</li>
<li>FlockDB</oli>
</ul>



<h3>DOCUMENT DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</h3>

<p>  Document orientated DBMS are systems designed for storing, modifying and managing semi-structured data .This system is also a member of the NOSQL family. Databases using the the document oriented model are very easy for developers or engineers to use because data are stored in either JSON or XML. The system uses internal structure of the document for identification and storage.The system also saves all information for a given item in a single instance of a database rather spread out over tables as with the relational system. </p>



<p>Examples of databases based on this system</p>

<ul>
<li>MongoDB</li>
<li>CouchDB</li>
<li>DocumentDB</li>
<li>OrientDB</li>
</ul>


<h3> THE TAKEAWAY  </h3>

<p> 

Most databases that fall under the non-relational umbrella " NOSQL" share common goals of speed and scalability. 
By breaking away from the relational storage model and leaving schemas behind, 
these databases are free of the limitations put upon them by a tightly bound schema


Databases have also come along way since thier creation in the 1960s, Initially they were a solution to the problem
of storing and protecting information we wrote down and making it more accessible at a faster rate. But over 
time they have become an integral part of our society and we solely rely on them for banking, security, policing and
provision of services for our digital lives. Big data is now helping find new insights from data we may have generated
in the past and it would be a very vital instrument in undertanding the society of the future.
Thank you..
